# Lakers Shot Prediction and Analysis

This project delves into the shot data of the Los Angeles Lakers, utilizing predictive models to analyze player performance, shot success rates, and shooting patterns. By employing machine learning techniques, this analysis aims to optimize strategies and enhance team performance.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Includes CSV files containing shot data, player stats, model metrics, and performance insights.
- **Scripts**: Data preprocessing scripts to clean, structure, and prepare data for modeling.
- **Notebook**: A Jupyter Notebook that showcases data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial data exploration to identify patterns in shot performance by player, location, and shot type.
- **Modeling Techniques**: 
  - **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification to predict shot success (made vs. missed) based on shot location and other features.
  - **Random Forest**: Employed for feature importance analysis and improved prediction accuracy.
  - **Gradient Boosting**: Enhances model accuracy through iterative training, adjusting for prediction errors.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Applied to classify shot outcomes with high accuracy on complex feature spaces.

- **Player Recommendations**: Data-driven suggestions based on model predictions, helping to refine shooting strategies.
